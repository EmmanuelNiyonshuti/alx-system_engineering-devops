			0x0C-web_server

	This project focuses on configuring a web server and automating tasks using Bash scripting.

	Background Context	
	
	Grading for some tasks will be based on two aspects:
	whether the web-01 server is configured according to requirements
	and if the answer file contains a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure
	an Ubuntu machine without any human intervention.
	For instance, instead of manually using Emacs to create a file or modify the Nginx configuration,
	tasks aim to automate these processes, improving efficiency and scalability.
	By automating repetitive tasks, one can focus on more stimulating challenges,
	especially crucial when managing numerous servers.

	To ensure consistency and efficiency, tasks adhere to specific guidelines outlined in the project requirements.
	Each Bash script must be executable, pass Shellcheck without errors, and include a comment explaining its purpose.
	Furthermore, systemctl is prohibited for restarting a process.
	By completing tasks and adhering to these guidelines, it improved my  understanding of web server management and automation,
	essential skills for System Reliability Engineers.
