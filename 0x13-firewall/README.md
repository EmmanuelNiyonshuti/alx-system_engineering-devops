	The Firewall project highlights the importance of protecting computer systems from online threats. 
	It covers the basics of firewalls, which serve as digital guards between devices and the internet
	controlling the flow of data.

	Throughout the project, I configured a straightforward firewall called ufw(unicomplicated firewall),
	commonly found on Linux servers. This allowed me to permit authorized traffic while blocking
	unauthorized connections by setting up rules based on factors like port numbers and IP addresses.

	Additionally, the project explored advanced techniques like port forwarding, which helps route 
	data to specific destinations, improving network efficiency and security
