				0x14. MySQL

		MySQL Infrastructure Setup
	In this project, I delved into setting up a robust MySQL infrastructure,
	covering concepts such as database installation, user management, replication, and backup strategies.
	By engaging with this project, I learned essential DevOps and SysAdmin tasks related to MySQL administration
	and web stack debugging.
	Through hands-on experience, I learned how to set up a primary-replica cluster,
	ensuring redundancy and load distribution while implementing effective backup strategies.

	Throughout this project, I explored key MySQL concepts, including database administration, replication,
	and backup strategies. I set up MySQL servers, created users with appropriate permissions,
	and established replication between primary and replica servers.
	By completing these tasks, I gained a deep understanding of MySQL infrastructure setup and maintenance,
	enabling me to handle critical database operations with confidence.
	Let's embark on this journey to master MySQL infrastructure deployment and management!
