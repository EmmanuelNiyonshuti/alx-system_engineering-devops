# 0x16. API advanced 

## Background Context
* Questions involving APIs are common for interviews. Sometimes they’re as simple as ‘write a Python script that queries a given endpoint’, sometimes they require you to use recursive functions and format/sort the results.

* A great API to use for some practice is the [Reddit API](). There’s a lot of endpoints available, many that don’t require any form of authentication, and there’s tons of information to be parsed out and presented. Getting comfortable with API calls now can save you some face during technical interviews and even outside of the job market, you might find personal use cases to make your life a little bit easier.

## overview

* In this Project I utilised the [RedditAPI](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) to retrieve and analyze data from various subreddits. by using requests module in python3 I wrote scripts that makes HTTP GET requests to the [RedditAPI](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/), specifically querying the `/hot` endpoint for each subreddit.
