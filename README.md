## alx-system_engineering-devops

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Welcome to my repository showcasing projects from the ALX System Engineering and DevOps track.
Here, you'll find a comprehensive collection of scripts and configurations covering a wide array of topics essential to modern IT operations and infrastructure management. Starting with `foundational Bash scripting`, `permissions management`, and `process control`, I progressed through advanced topics like `network configuration`, `web server optimization`, and `troubleshooting methodologies`. Projects also include in-depth explorations of security measures such as `HTTPS implementation`, `firewall management`, `database administration with MySQL`, and `Linux server management`. I've also gained proficiency in `API interactions`, `web stack debugging`, `system monitoring techniques`, `SSH`, and more.

Each directory represents a different module or topic, showcasing my progress and hands-on learning journey in mastering essential skills for system administration, DevOps practices, and web infrastructure design.
